# Computer science study plan

## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from lawyer (no CS degree) to software engineer. As I complete material, I convert the relevant parts of this readme from forward-looking plan to backward-looking reference so that I have an organized list of what I've covered.

If you're looking to create your own plan, I would recommend making your own fork from [jwasham's repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

## Why use it?

When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to
traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.
Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked
under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an "out of
memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and
thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough

- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.

## Book List and Reference Resources

### Interview Prep
I've mostly used these books for general guidance rather than as a source of practice problems (instead using coding-challenge sites for practice problems).

- [X] [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/)
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java

### Discrete Mathematics

- [ ] [Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science, Second Edition, Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth and Oren Patashnik](https://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025/)
- [ ] [MIT OpenCourseWare Mathematics for Computer Science, Spring 2015 version](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/). Personally, I've found pairing the 2015 course textbook pdf with the 2010 lectures works well for me.

### Algorithms

- [ ] [Algorithms, Jeff Erickson](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)

### C

- [ ] [The C Programming Language, Second Edtition, Brian W. Kernigan and Dennis M. Ritchie](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)   ("KRC")
        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little
            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.
        - [answers to questions](https://github.com/lekkas/c-algorithms)

- Django React Framework source code [repo](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework)

##### JSON Web Token authentication in a Django-React project
I implemented my flashcards website's user authentication with JWT, since it seemed like a good chance to play with "production" JWT in a low-risk environment. 
- Detailed walkthrough [article](https://hackernoon.com/110percent-complete-jwt-authentication-with-django-and-react-2020-iejq34ta) by Stuart Leitch.

## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each
    - [ ] Which algorithms can be used on linked lists? Which on arrays? Which on both?
        - [Merge Sort For Linked List](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-for-linked-list/)

- For heapsort, see Heap data structure above. Heap sort is great, but not stable.

    - [ ] [Implementation (Python)](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python/blob/master/quick_sort/quick_sort.py)

- [ ] Implement:
    - [ ] Mergesort: O(n log n) average and worst case
    - [ ] Quicksort O(n log n) average case
    - Selection sort and insertion sort are both O(n^2) average and worst case
    - For heapsort, see Heap data structure above.

As a summary, here is a visual representation of [15 sorting algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg).

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code

    - how is tail recursion better than not?

    - basic memoization

- ## Dynamic Programming
    - You probably won't see any dynamic programming problems in your interview, but it's worth being able to recognize a problem as being a candidate for dynamic programming.
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.
